# Training
st.header("üéì Training:")
st.write('''Now, let's peek behind the curtain and see how Phi-3-Mini gets its smarts. It all starts with the training process, where Phi-3-Mini learns from tons of data to understand and generate human-like text.

First, Microsoft carefully curates a massive dataset from various sources on the internet. They handpick the best-quality content and filter out the noise to ensure Phi-3-Mini learns from the cream of the crop.

But that's not all. Phi-3-Mini also learns from synthetic data generated by larger language models. This synthetic data teaches Phi-3-Mini logical reasoning skills and other niche capabilities, making it a well-rounded AI powerhouse.

The training process is done in two phases. In the first phase, Phi-3-Mini focuses on absorbing knowledge from the curated web data to build its general understanding of language. Then, in the second phase, it incorporates a selective subset of web data along with synthetic data to enhance its reasoning abilities.

By fine-tuning the training data mixture to match Phi-3-Mini's size, Microsoft ensures that the model performs at its best, delivering impressive results from its compact size''')

In the fast-paced world of AI development, the rise of small language models (SLMs) has been pretty mind-blowing. Google kicked things off with their Gemma 7B parameter model, followed by the impressive Llama-3 8B parameter model, and the game hasn't been the same since. These models, despite being relatively small in size, have punched way above their weight class, giving the big boys a run for their money.

Now, with Microsoft's Phi-3 stepping into the ring with its 3 billion parameters and still managing to outperform larger models, it's got everyone wondering: are SLMs about to steal the show? Could this be the year where size doesn't matter as much in the AI world? As SLMs keep getting better and showing off what they can do, it's starting to seem like the days of giant models ruling the roost might be numbered. So, what's your take on all this? Are we on the brink of a new era where smaller models reign supreme?''')
